#
# This role configures LXD on a bare metal host. 
#
# This role assumes LVM is configured with at least these
# volume groups:
#
# /dev/vg-ssd - Volume group with SSD space
# /dev/vg-disk - Volume group with HDD space
#
# It will create the mounts:
#
# /data/homes (disk vg) - Home directories inside containers.
#
# It will create the directories: 
#
# /data/homes/ubuntu - Copy of the host's /home/ubuntu with SSH keys
# /data/config - Shared configuration for containers. 
#
# After this role xld will be installed and initialized and the ubuntu
# user will be placed into the lxd group.
